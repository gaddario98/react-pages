---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Configure Universal Page with Full Customization (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to configure a complete page with forms, data queries, and dynamic content through a single unified PageProps interface that works on both web and React Native.

**Independent Test**: Create a basic page configuration with form fields and queries, then render it on both web and React Native, verifying that the same configuration produces appropriate output on both platforms.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T041 [US1] Add platform override resolution logic to hooks/usePageConfig.tsx (merge web/native overrides based on detected platform)
- [X] T042 [US1] Update config/types.ts with backward-compatible type exports (PageMetadataProps alias for MetadataConfig)
- [X] T043 [US1] Add validation logic for PageProps (warn if id empty, all contents/form/queries undefined, circular dependencies detected)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - basic page configuration works on both web and React Native with dependency tracking and platform adapters.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Optimize Rendering Performance Across Platforms (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Intelligently prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize component updates so pages remain fluid and responsive on both web and mobile devices.

**Independent Test**: Create a page with 10+ content sections and multiple form fields, trigger rapid updates (typing, query refetches), and measure frame rates and re-render counts to verify they stay within performance targets (60 FPS, max 3 re-renders per change).

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T044 [P] [US2] Implement useDependencyGraph hook with graph initialization, node registration, and affected component calculation
- [X] T045 [P] [US2] Implement useMemoizedProps hook with precise dependency tracking for MappedProps object (formValues, setValue, allQuery, allMutation)

- [X] T056 [US2] Create tests/utils/performance-utils.ts with re-render counter and FPS measurement utilities for validation
- [ ] T057 [US2] Add performance monitoring hooks in PageGenerator for development mode (re-render count warnings if > 3 per change) [OPTIONAL - can be added later if needed]

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - pages render efficiently with minimal re-renders during interactions.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Generate SEO and AI Metadata Dynamically (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable developers to define metadata (title, description, Open Graph, structured data, AI hints) that search engines, social media platforms, and AI crawlers can properly understand and index.

**Independent Test**: Configure a page with metadata props, render it server-side or in a web environment, and verify that appropriate meta tags, structured data JSON-LD, and AI hints are injected into the document head.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T069 [US3] Add i18n integration to useMetadata hook for translating metadata strings with react-i18next
- [X] T070 [US3] Update config/platformAdapters/web.ts injectMetadata method to call enhanced setMetadata()
- [X] T071 [US3] Update config/platformAdapters/native.ts injectMetadata method to log metadata (no-op for rendering, store for SSR/analytics)
- [X] T072 [US3] Add validation logic for MetadataConfig (warn if no fields defined, invalid URLs, noindex with structured data)
- [X] T073 [US3] Enhance getMetadata() in config/metadata.ts for SSR framework integration (return current metadata state)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories 1-3 should now work independently - pages have SEO metadata, performance optimization, and cross-platform rendering.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Extend and Customize All System Behaviors (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive extension points (custom components, render functions, hooks, lifecycle callbacks) so developers can adapt the system to any edge case without forking the library.

**Independent Test**: Replace default components (PageContainer, ItemsContainer, FormManager) with custom implementations, verifying that custom components receive expected props and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.

- [X] T083 [US4] Update hooks/usePageConfig.tsx to merge custom configuration with defaults (deep merge with precedence rules)
- [X] T084 [US4] Create utils/merge.ts utility for configuration deep merging (handle arrays, objects, primitives correctly)
- [ ] T085 [US4] Add custom hook injection support in PageGenerator (allow consumers to inject custom hooks via config) [DEFERRED - advanced extensibility]

- [ ] T088 [US4] Update contracts/examples/custom-adapter.tsx with complete custom platform adapter example [DEFERRED - examples]

**Checkpoint**: System is now fully customizable - all default behaviors can be overridden without modifying library source code.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Lazy Load Content and Code Split Bundles (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Support lazy loading and code splitting so users only download code when they need it, reducing initial load time and improving perceived performance.

**Independent Test**: Configure a page with conditional content marked for lazy loading, load the page, verify that lazy code is not initially downloaded, then trigger the condition and verify the code loads on demand.

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [X] T099 [US5] Integrate ErrorBoundary into LazyContent with retry logic for failed bundle loads
- [X] T100 [US5] Add platform-specific lazy loading behavior (web: IntersectionObserver, native: immediate load)
- [X] T101 [US5] Update config/platformAdapters/web.ts supportsFeature to return true for lazy loading features
- [X] T102 [US5] Update config/platformAdapters/native.ts supportsFeature to handle graceful lazy loading degradation
- [X] T103 [US5] Update contracts/examples/lazy-page.tsx with complete lazy loading example (viewport + conditional triggers)

**Checkpoint**: All 5 user stories are now complete - pages support full configuration, performance optimization, SEO metadata, customization, and lazy loading.

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and final preparation for release

- [X] T104 [P] Create MIGRATION.md documenting all breaking changes from 1.x to 2.x with before/after code examples
