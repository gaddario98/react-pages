- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification successfully avoids implementation details. It focuses on capabilities like "memoize content items" and "inject metadata" without specifying React.memo, useMemo, or specific libraries.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate developer value (the "customers" of this library) such as "configure everything through a single unified PageProps interface" and "intelligently prevent unnecessary re-renders."

✅ **Non-technical language**: The spec uses terminology accessible to product managers and stakeholders. Technical terms (queries, forms, metadata) are explained in context.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and thoroughly filled out.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are fully specified using reasonable defaults (e.g., React 19+, 60 FPS performance target, 60 KB gzipped bundle size).

✅ **Testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement uses precise language with clear verbs (MUST accept, MUST support, MUST memoize). Requirements like FR-008 "MUST track dependency relationships" are specific enough to verify in testing.

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All success criteria include quantifiable metrics:
  - SC-001: "under 100 lines of configuration code"
  - SC-003: "maintain 60 FPS (under 16ms per render)"
  - SC-006: "complete metadata... before first contentful paint"
  - SC-009: "under 60 KB gzipped for the complete package"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes ("developers can configure", "pages maintain 60 FPS", "bundle size remains under 60 KB") without mentioning specific APIs or implementation techniques.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: All 5 user stories include concrete acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format that describe verifiable outcomes.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: The spec lists 8 specific edge cases covering configuration conflicts, circular dependencies, platform differences, error handling, and race conditions.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 10 areas (UI component library, routing, authentication, state management, testing infrastructure, etc.) to prevent scope creep.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: The "Assumptions" section documents 10 critical assumptions about React versions, build tooling, data fetching, form management, and platform parity.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each of the 35 functional requirements is specific and verifiable. For example, FR-016 "MUST inject metadata into document head on web platforms" can be tested by rendering a page and inspecting the DOM.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 5 prioritized user stories cover the complete feature scope:
  - P1: Core configuration system
  - P2: Performance optimization
  - P3: Metadata/SEO
  - P4: Extensibility
  - P5: Lazy loading

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: The 10 success criteria align with the functional requirements and provide concrete metrics for validating that the feature delivers its promised value.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec successfully maintains abstraction. Terms like "memoization", "dependency graph", and "lazy loading" describe concepts, not specific React APIs. Implementation is left to the planning phase.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for planning

The specification is complete, high-quality, and ready to proceed to the `/speckit.plan` phase. All checklist items pass validation. The spec provides:

1. Clear user value through 5 prioritized, independently testable user stories
2. 35 unambiguous functional requirements organized by category
3. 10 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
4. Comprehensive edge cases, assumptions, and scope boundaries
5. Full backward compatibility consideration while enabling major improvements

No updates or clarifications are needed before proceeding to implementation planning.
