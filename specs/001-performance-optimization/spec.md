## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-29

- Q: Testing Removal Scope → A: Remove ALL testing references including acceptance scenarios, Independent Test sections, and test-related success criteria

## User Scenarios *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Eliminate Unnecessary Re-renders (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the React Pages library, when I build complex pages with multiple forms, queries, and dynamic content, I want the library to intelligently prevent unnecessary component re-renders so that my application remains responsive and fluid even with frequent data updates or user interactions.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of performance optimization. Excessive re-renders are the primary cause of sluggish UIs in React applications. Fixing this delivers immediate, measurable performance improvements that users notice instantly.

---

### User Story 2 - Optimize Hook Dependencies and Memoization (Priority: P2)

As a developer integrating this library, when I configure pages with complex dependencies between forms, queries, and content, I want the library's internal hooks to maintain stable references and efficient dependency arrays so that my pages avoid cascading re-renders and maintain predictable performance characteristics.

**Why this priority**: After eliminating unnecessary re-renders (P1), optimizing internal hook behavior ensures the library itself doesn't become a performance bottleneck. This builds on P1 by making the optimization sustainable even as page complexity grows.

---

### User Story 3 - Reduce Bundle Size and Tree-Shaking (Priority: P3)

As a developer building a production application, when I import specific features from the React Pages library (e.g., only hooks without full page components), I want the build tool to include only the code I use so that my application bundle remains small and loads quickly for end users.

**Why this priority**: While P1 and P2 optimize runtime performance, P3 optimizes load-time performance. After addressing rendering efficiency, reducing bundle size completes the performance optimization by improving initial page load times.

---

### User Story 4 - Lazy Loading and Code Splitting (Priority: P4)

As a developer building large applications, when I configure pages with many optional features (e.g., conditional forms, dynamic content blocks), I want the library to support lazy loading of components and data fetchers so that users only download code when they actually need it, reducing initial load time.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced optimization that builds on P1-P3. Once core rendering is efficient (P1), hooks are optimized (P2), and bundle size is reduced (P3), lazy loading provides further gains for large-scale applications.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a page has circular dependencies between form values and query parameters (e.g., form field A depends on query B, which depends on form field A)?
- How does the system handle rapidly changing form inputs (e.g., user typing quickly) without causing render storms?
- What happens when a component is memoized but receives new function references as props on every render?
- How does the library behave when a query refetches while a component consuming it is simultaneously updating local state?
- What happens when multiple mutations complete simultaneously and all depend on the same query invalidation?
- How does lazy loading handle race conditions when the same component is conditionally shown, hidden, and shown again rapidly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST memoize component render outputs using React.memo() with custom comparison functions for complex props
- **FR-002**: System MUST use stable callback references (useCallback) for all event handlers passed to child components
- **FR-003**: System MUST compute derived values using useMemo() with precise dependency arrays that trigger recalculation only when inputs change
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract and cache query/mutation data with stable object references to prevent downstream re-renders
- **FR-005**: System MUST track which components depend on which queries/form fields to enable selective re-rendering
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement prop diffing to detect when memoized components can skip re-rendering
- **FR-007**: System MUST expose bundle entry points for hooks, components, utils, and config as separate modules
- **FR-008**: System MUST mark all modules with sideEffects: false in package.json to enable tree-shaking
- **FR-009**: System MUST avoid importing entire dependency libraries; use targeted imports (e.g., import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query' instead of import * as ReactQuery)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support React.lazy() and Suspense boundaries for optional/conditional page features
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide configuration options to enable/disable lazy loading per feature
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain stable hook execution order across re-renders (no conditional hooks)
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent hook dependency array over-inclusion (listing stable values that never change)
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent object/array literals in hook dependencies (prefer memoized references)
- **FR-015**: System MUST batch multiple state updates that occur in the same event handler using React's automatic batching
- **FR-016**: System MUST support React Native by ensuring all optimizations work in both web and native environments
- **FR-019**: System MUST document required consumer-side optimizations (e.g., stable container components, proper key props)
- **FR-020**: System MUST refactor project structure to separate performance-critical code from convenience wrappers

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Component Render Tree**: The hierarchy of React components comprising a page, including header, body, footer, content blocks, and forms. Performance-critical paths include form field rendering and query-dependent content updates.
- **Dependency Graph**: A mapping of which components depend on which queries, mutations, and form values. Used to determine minimal re-render scope when data changes.
- **Memoization Cache**: Internal caches maintained by useMemo/useCallback hooks storing computed values and callback references. Invalidated only when dependencies change.
- **Bundle Module**: A discrete output file (e.g., hooks/index.mjs, components/index.mjs) that can be independently imported and tree-shaken. Each module should have minimal cross-dependencies.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Pages with 10+ content sections re-render targeted components in under 16ms (60 FPS) when a single form field changes
- **SC-002**: Complex pages with 5 active queries experience no more than 3 component re-renders when a single query updates
- **SC-003**: Applications importing only hooks or only components achieve at least 40% smaller bundle size compared to importing the entire library
- **SC-004**: Pages with lazy-loaded conditional content show 30% faster initial load time (time to interactive) compared to eagerly loading all content
- **SC-005**: Typing in form fields maintains 60 FPS (16ms per keystroke) even with 20+ fields and complex validation logic
- **SC-006**: Main library bundle (dist/index.mjs) is under 50 KB gzipped, with per-module bundles under 20 KB gzipped
- **SC-007**: Build process completes with zero Rollup warnings related to circular dependencies, side effects, or tree-shaking issues
- **SC-009**: Consumer applications report subjective performance improvement ("page feels faster") in user experience

## Assumptions

1. **React Version**: Library targets React 19+, which includes automatic batching and improved memo comparison. Optimizations assume modern React features are available.
2. **Build Tooling**: Consumers use build tools with tree-shaking support (Rollup, Webpack 5+, Vite, or esbuild). Bundle size metrics assume tree-shaking is enabled.
3. **Development Environment**: Performance optimizations are active in both development and production modes, with minimal overhead in production builds.
4. **Component Complexity**: Success criteria target "typical" pages with 5-20 content sections, 1-10 queries, and 1-50 form fields. Extreme cases (100+ sections) may require consumer-side optimizations.
5. **React Native Support**: While the library supports React Native, initial optimization focus is on React web. Native-specific optimizations (e.g., FlatList virtualization) are out of scope unless they don't add web-specific overhead.
6. **Consumer Responsibility**: Consumers must provide stable container components and proper key props. Library optimizations cannot compensate for unstable parent components forcing full subtree re-renders.
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Performance improvements should not introduce breaking API changes. Internal restructuring is acceptable; public API surface remains stable (semver MINOR/PATCH).

## Out of Scope

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Optimization**: While the library should remain SSR-compatible, this feature focuses on client-side rendering performance only.
- **Data Fetching Strategy Changes**: Optimizations focus on React rendering; changes to TanStack Query configuration or data fetching patterns are out of scope.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Features**: Unrelated to performance; handled separately.
- **New API Features**: This is an optimization-focused feature; no new user-facing APIs unless required for opt-in performance modes.
- **Visual Design Changes**: No UI/UX changes; purely internal performance improvements.
- **Cross-Library Optimizations**: Optimizing dependent libraries (@gaddario98/react-auth, react-form, react-queries) is out of scope; focus is on this library only.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Formal test suites, test frameworks, and automated testing tools are out of scope for this optimization feature.
