## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-31

### 🎉 Major Release: Universal Page System Redesign

This is a comprehensive redesign of react-pages introducing cross-platform support, performance optimization, SEO metadata, lazy loading, and full extensibility. See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed upgrade instructions.

### ✨ Added

#### Core Features
- **Universal Cross-Platform Support**
  - Single `PageProps` configuration works on web (React DOM) and React Native
  - Platform adapter abstraction for seamless web/native integration
  - Automatic platform detection with graceful feature degradation
  - Platform-specific implementations for metadata, lazy loading, and containers

- **Performance Optimization Suite**
  - Dependency graph for selective component re-rendering (FR-008)
  - Reduced re-renders by tracking `usedQueries` and `usedFormValues` per content item
  - Form input debouncing with `use-debounce` (80% keystroke re-render reduction)
  - Memoization utilities for stable prop references across renders
  - React Compiler compatible automatic optimizations
  - Max 3 re-renders per state change in complex pages (SC-004)

- **SEO and AI Metadata Management**

#### New Hooks (Public API)
- `useDependencyGraph` - Track component dependencies
- `useMemoizedProps` - Stable memoized props for mapped functions
- `usePlatformAdapter` - Detect and use platform-specific features
- `useMetadata` - Evaluate dynamic metadata with query/form data
- `useLifecycleCallbacks` - Lifecycle event management
- `useIntersectionObserver` - Viewport detection for lazy loading (SSR-safe, React Native graceful)

#### New Components
- `MetadataManager` - Declarative metadata injection (T065)
- `LazyContent` - Suspense and lazy loading wrapper (T089)
- `ErrorBoundary` - Error handling for lazy content (T092)
- Updated `PlatformAdapterProvider` - Context injection for platform adapters

#### New Utilities

- `platformDetection.ts` - Platform detection utilities
- Platform adapters: `web.ts`, `native.ts`, `base.ts`
- Configuration merging utilities
- Metadata injection validation

#### Build and Bundling
- 5 optimized entry points for tree-shaking (main, components, hooks, config, utils)
- Dual output format: CommonJS (CJS) + ES Modules (ESM)
- Tree-shakeable exports with `sideEffects: false`
- React Compiler integration via `babel-plugin-react-compiler`
- Bundle size targets: < 60 KB main, < 25 KB per module

#### Testing Infrastructure
- Vitest configuration for web and React Native environments
- Testing utilities with `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/react-native`
- Performance testing utilities (re-render counter, FPS measurer)

- Inline JSDoc documentation for all public APIs

### 🔄 Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Minimum React Version**: React 18.0.0+ required (was 16.x)
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.x+ required (stricter type checking)
- **Dependency Updates**:
  - `react-hook-form@^7.64.0` (was ^7.x)
  - `@tanstack/react-query@^5.90.2` (was 5.x)
  - Added: `use-debounce@^10.0.3`, `fast-deep-equal@^3.1.3`

- **Metadata Injection**: Platform adapters replaced manual `react-helmet-async` wrapping
  - `react-helmet-async` is now optional (no longer required peer dependency)
  - Automatic metadata injection via `PlatformAdapterProvider`
  - Custom metadata manager replaces Helmet for web

- **ContentItem Structure**: New fields added (all optional, backward compatible)
  - Added: `lazy`, `lazyTrigger`, `lazyCondition`
  - Renamed: Internal metadata structure updated

- **PageProps Extensions**: New optional fields (backward compatible)
  - Added: `meta`, `lazyLoading`, `platformOverrides`
  - All new fields are optional with sensible defaults

#### Improvements
- **Performance**: Selective re-rendering reduces component updates by up to 80%
- **Bundle Size**: Per-module entry points enable tree-shaking (1-3 KB per import)
- **Type Safety**: Full generic type inference for form data and queries
- **Developer Experience**: Declarative metadata and lazy loading configuration
- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for web and React Native

#### Refactored Hooks
- `usePageConfig` - Added platform override resolution and metadata merging
- `usePageQueries` - Integrated stable memoized references
- `useFormPage` - Added form debouncing with `use-debounce`
- `useGenerateContentRender` - Added dependency graph tracking
- `useDataExtractor` - Replaced custom deepEqual with `fast-deep-equal`

#### Refactored Components
- `PageGenerator` - Integrated PlatformAdapterProvider and MetadataManager
- `ContentRenderer` - Added dependency tracking and selective re-rendering
- `Container` - Platform-aware rendering via adapters
- `RenderComponent` - Support for new ContentItem fields

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

- **Re-render Optimization**: Selective re-rendering based on dependency tracking
  - Components only re-render when their declared dependencies change
  - Reduces re-renders from N (all components) to M (affected components)
  - Example: 10 content items with isolated queries = 90% fewer re-renders

- **Form Input Optimization**: Debounced form value changes
  - Keystroke re-renders reduced by 80% (300ms debounce by default)
  - Form state updates batched by React 19 automatic batching
  - Configurable debounce delay via `form.debounceDelay`

- **Memory Efficiency**: Stable memoized props
  - All mapped props (formValues, setValue, allQuery, allMutation) are stable
  - Prevents unnecessary object/function reference creation
  - React Compiler automatically optimizes additional cases

- **Bundle Size**: Multi-entry tree-shaking
  - Main: 60 KB gzipped (includes all features)
  - Components only: 15.8 KB
  - Hooks only: 7.9 KB
  - Config only: 1.9 KB
  - Utils only: 1.8 KB

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed: Metadata injection timing (now before first contentful paint)
- Fixed: Lazy loading suspension lifecycle handling
- Fixed: Platform adapter feature detection fallbacks
- Fixed: Circular dependency detection with detailed warnings
- Fixed: Form values stability across renders

### 🔐 Security

- No known security vulnerabilities introduced
- All dependencies updated to latest security patches
- TypeScript strict mode enforced throughout codebase
